# Advanced RAG with Gemini

This project showcases an advanced implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Google Gemini model.

**Key Features:**

- **PDF Information Extraction:** Extracts relevant information from a given PDF document.
- **Text Chunking:** Divides the extracted content into manageable chunks for more efficient processing.
- **Embedding Conversion:** Converts text chunks into vector embeddings using state-of-the-art models.
- **Chroma Database:** Stores and manages embeddings in a Chroma database for fast retrieval.
- **Google Gemini Model:** Leverages the Gemini model to perform RAG, providing contextually relevant answers from the extracted content.
